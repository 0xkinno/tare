# Proposed standing orders

Status: order 1 PLACED by the owner on 2026-10-10 (order 9 on the book, approve 0x032111a8...9ac5, placeBuy 0x763a19fe...2970, filled by the keeper within the minute). Orders 2 to 6 are still only proposed. Total at risk if all buys fill: $0.15 of USDT, plus 0.0003 NVDA shares offered for sale.
Owner wallet: 0x3939...3Ed5. Deadlines are spread from 12 to 23 Oct 2026 (UTC).

| # | Order | Deadline (UTC) | Designed outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Buy NVDA, tight tolerance | 2026-10-12 23:59 | Fills at the Monday open if the net premium stays inside 0.25%. |
| 2 | Buy TSLA, normal tolerance | 2026-10-14 23:59 | Fills when TSLA has a contract route and a live reference. |
| 3 | Buy AAPL, wide tolerance | 2026-10-17 23:59 | Fills early in the week; the wide band keeps it patient. Restricted to bStocks because Ondo names need a 5 USD aggregator order. |
| 4 | Sell NVDA above the reference | 2026-10-19 23:59 | Sells 0.0002 NVDA shares only if each share fetches at least $240. Stays open until the price gets there or the deadline passes. |
| 5 | Buy MSFT with an unreachable floor (designed to refuse) | 2026-10-21 23:59 | Placed with a share floor of one whole share for five cents (encoded by scripts/mainnet/agentic_calls.ts, not by the planner, which would never produce it). The keeper must refuse with PREMIUM_ABOVE_LIMIT on every pass and the diary shows it. The calls below show the planner normal floor for comparison; only minShares changes. |
| 6 | Sell NVDA at an impossible price (designed to refuse) | 2026-10-23 23:59 | A sell floor of $99,999 per share: the keeper refuses for the whole window and the order expires unfilled. |
